# terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform Module that implements a CloudFront Distribution (CDN) for a custom origin (e.g. website) and [ships logs to a bucket](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-log-storage). 

If you need to accelerate an S3 bucket, we suggest using [`terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn) instead.

## Usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
module "cdn" {
  source             = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn.git?ref=master"
  namespace          = "cp"
  stage              = "prod"
  name               = "app"
  aliases            = ["cloudposse.com", "www.cloudposse.com"]
  parent_zone_name   = "cloudposse.com"
  origin_domain_name = "origin.cloudposse.com"
}
```

### Generating ACM Certificate

Use the AWS cli to [request new ACM certifiates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request.html) (requires email validation)
```
aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --subject-alternative-names a.example.com b.example.com *.c.example.com
```
