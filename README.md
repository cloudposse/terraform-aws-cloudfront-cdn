Terraform Module that implements a CloudFront Distribution (CDN) for a custom origin (e.g. website) and [ships logs to a bucket](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-log-storage).

If you need to accelerate an S3 bucket, we suggest using [`terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn) instead.

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) approach towards DevOps.

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn/releases).


Basic usage:

```hcl
module "cdn" {
  source             = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn.git?ref=master"
  namespace          = "cp"
  stage              = "prod"
  name               = "app"
  aliases            = ["example.com", "www.example.com"]
  parent_zone_name   = "example.com"
  origin_domain_name = "origin.example.com"
}
```


Complete example of setting up CloudFront Distribution with Cache Behaviors for a WordPress site: [`examples/complete`](examples/complete/main.tf)


### Generating ACM Certificate

Use the AWS cli to [request new ACM certifiates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request.html) (requires email validation)
```
aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --subject-alternative-names a.example.com b.example.com *.c.example.com
```
